# Implementation of CAREL: Instruction-Guid reinforcement learning with cross-modal auxiliary objectives

This repository presents an implementation of CAREL (Cross-modal Auxiliary REinforcement Learning) on the Semantic HELM (SHELM) and BabyAI. CAREL is a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates the concept of cross-modality to enhance agent learning.

## Installation

You can follow the steps in the original SHELM [repository](https://github.com/ml-jku/helm).
